# Facial Keypoints and Draw Convex Hull
Facial keypoints Detection and drawing of Convex Hull.
Here we implemented Facial Key points detection model with the concepts of CNN using Tensorflow. Then using OpenCV we created Convex Hull of face and attempted to detect facial expression by calculating proximity of two selected keypoints.We were able to achieve an accuracy of 89.3\% on training datasets.
